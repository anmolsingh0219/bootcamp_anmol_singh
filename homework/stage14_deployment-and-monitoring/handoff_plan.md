# Deployment Handoff Plan
## Options Pricing Model Production Deployment

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- **Model Validation**: Confirm MAE <$70 on holdout test set from last 30 days of market data
- **Infrastructure Testing**: Load test Flask API at 1000 req/sec with <100ms p95 latency
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Implement Black-Scholes fallback with automatic switchover if model fails
- **Monitoring Setup**: Deploy Grafana dashboards with all four monitoring layers configured
- **Runbook Creation**: Document rollback procedures and escalation contacts

### Deployment Steps
- **Stage 1**: Deploy to shadow mode alongside existing pricing system for 1 week validation
- **Stage 2**: Enable for 10% of low-risk options trades with manual approval override
- **Stage 3**: Gradual rollout to 50% then 100% of trades based on performance metrics
- **Rollback Trigger**: Immediate fallback if MAE exceeds $100 or API latency >250ms for 5 minutes

### Ongoing Maintenance Responsibilities
- **Daily**: Platform team monitors system health and API performance metrics
- **Weekly**: Quant analysts review prediction accuracy and business KPIs against benchmarks  
- **Monthly**: ML team evaluates model drift and initiates retraining if PSI >0.25 on key features
- **Quarterly**: Full model validation and potential architecture updates based on market conditions

### Emergency Contacts & Runbooks
- **System Issues**: Platform on-call via PagerDuty → Runbook: `/wiki/options-api-troubleshooting`
- **Model Performance**: ML team lead → Runbook: `/wiki/model-rollback-procedures`  
- **Business Impact**: Trading desk manager → Runbook: `/wiki/pricing-system-fallback`
