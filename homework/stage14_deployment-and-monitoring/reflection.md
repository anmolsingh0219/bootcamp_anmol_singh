# Stage 14: Deployment & Monitoring Reflection
## Options Pricing Model Production Readiness

### Deployment Risks

The options pricing model faces several critical risks if deployed to production. **Data quality degradation** represents the highest risk, as the model's 19.3% performance improvement depends on complete volatility data. Missing or stale market data could trigger systematic prediction errors. **Model drift** poses significant concern given the low RÂ² (15.6%), making the model sensitive to market regime changes that weren't captured in training data. **Latency failures** during high-volatility periods could result in outdated predictions when speed matters most for trading decisions.

**Feature distribution shifts** in moneyness or volatility ranges could push inputs outside validated bounds (0.1-2.0 volatility, 0.5-2.0 moneyness), causing prediction failures. **Infrastructure failures** affecting the Flask API or model loading could result in trading system outages during critical market hours.

### Four-Layer Monitoring Strategy

**Data Layer**: Monitor volatility data freshness (alert if >5 minutes stale), null rate in implied_volatility field (alert if >10%), and schema hash validation to detect upstream data changes.

**Model Layer**: Track rolling 7-day MAE (alert if >$80), prediction confidence interval width (alert if >$200), and feature distribution drift using PSI (alert if >0.25 on any feature).

**System Layer**: Monitor p95 API latency (alert if >100ms), Flask app error rate (alert if >2%), and model loading success rate (alert if <99%).

**Business Layer**: Track prediction accuracy on live trades (weekly review), trading system uptime during market hours (alert if <99.9%), and options pricing deviation from market benchmarks.

### Ownership & Handoffs

**Data Engineering** owns upstream data pipelines and freshness monitoring. **ML Engineering** maintains model performance metrics and retraining triggers (monthly or when rolling MAE exceeds $80). **Platform Engineering** manages system health and API reliability. **Quantitative Analysts** validate business metrics and approve model rollbacks. Issues escalate through Slack alerts to on-call engineers, with critical failures triggering immediate model fallback to Black-Scholes pricing until resolution.
