# European Options Pricing with Machine Learning

## Project Scoping

The pricing of European options using the traditional Black-Scholes model is a cornerstone of modern finance, but it is fundamentally flawed. The model's rigid assumptions about market behavior (like constant volatility) lead to systematic deviations between its theoretical values and real-world market prices. For traders who rely on precision, this pricing "error" can lead to significant losses or missed arbitrage opportunities. This project aims to solve this accuracy problem by building a machine learning model that learns and corrects for the inherent errors of the Black-Scholes formula.

The primary stakeholder is an options trader or a quantitative analyst on a derivatives desk. This user needs immediate, highly accurate pricing data to make informed trading decisions and manage their portfolio's risk exposure. A model that is systematically wrong, even by a small amount, is a critical liability. The useful answer for this stakeholder is predictive; we are forecasting the error of the Black-Scholes model based on market parameters. The final output will be a functional artifact: a Python script or notebook that takes market inputs (e.g., stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, time to maturity) and returns a price that has been corrected by the machine learning model, providing a more reliable valuation almost instantly.
