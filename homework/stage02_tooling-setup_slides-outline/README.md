# Bermudan Options Pricing with Machine Learning

## Project Scoping

The pricing of exotic options, such as Bermudan options, presents a significant computational challenge in finance. Unlike simpler European options, Bermudan options can be exercised on several specific dates before expiration. Traditional pricing methods, like Monte Carlo simulations or binomial lattices, are often computationally intensive and slow, making it difficult for traders to assess risks and opportunities in real-time. This project aims to solve this efficiency problem by developing a machine learning model to rapidly and accurately predict the price of Bermudan put options on a single underlying asset.

The primary stakeholder is an exotic options trader or a quantitative analyst (quant) on a derivatives desk. This user needs immediate pricing data to make informed trading decisions, manage their portfolio's risk exposure (the "Greeks"), and identify potential arbitrage opportunities. A slow pricing model directly translates to lost opportunities and increased risk. The useful answer for this stakeholder is predictive; we are forecasting the option's price based on market parameters. The final output will be a functional artifact: a Python script or notebook that takes market inputs (e.g., stock price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, time to maturity, and exercise dates) and returns a predicted price and its associated risk sensitivities almost instantly.
