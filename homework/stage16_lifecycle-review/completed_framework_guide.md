# Applied Financial Engineering — Framework Guide

## Options Pricing Model Project Lifecycle

| Lifecycle Stage | What You Did | Challenges | Solutions / Decisions | Future Improvements |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| **1. Problem Framing & Scoping** | Defined options pricing prediction problem using implied volatility, moneyness, and time-to-expiry as features to predict market prices. Set success metric as MAE reduction. | Unclear which features would be most predictive for options pricing. Multiple competing objectives between accuracy and interpretability. | Focused on linear regression for interpretability. Defined clear success metrics (MAE, R²). Limited scope to basic features initially. | Better domain research upfront. Clearer stakeholder interviews to define business requirements and risk tolerance. |
| **2. Tooling Setup** | Configured Python environment with pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib. Set up Jupyter notebooks for development. Created stage13_env for production deployment. | Version compatibility issues between sklearn versions. Environment conflicts between development and deployment. | Created dedicated environments for different stages. Used requirements.txt for reproducibility. Solved sklearn version mismatch by retraining model. | Automate environment setup with Docker containers. Use version pinning from project start. |
| **3. Python Fundamentals** | Applied pandas for data manipulation, numpy for calculations, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization. Used classes and functions for code organization. | Initial inefficient code with repeated operations. Limited experience with object-oriented design patterns. | Refactored code into reusable functions. Created utility modules for common operations. Added proper error handling and logging. | Strengthen unit testing skills. Improve code documentation and type hints. Learn more advanced pandas operations. |
| **4. Data Acquisition / Ingestion** | Simulated options data acquisition through CSV files representing market data feeds. Structured data loading with error handling. | Simulated data may not reflect real market conditions. No real-time data feeds to work with. | Used realistic options data structure with standard fields. Implemented data validation checks. Created repeatable data loading processes. | Integrate with real options data APIs. Add streaming data capabilities. Implement data quality monitoring. |
| **5. Data Storage** | Stored data in CSV and Parquet formats in organized directory structure. Used timestamped files for versioning. | File-based storage doesn't scale well. No schema enforcement or data lineage tracking. | Organized data into raw/processed directories. Used consistent naming conventions. Implemented data validation before storage. | Move to database storage with proper schema. Add data versioning and lineage tracking. Implement automated backup strategies. |
| **6. Data Preprocessing** | Implemented missing value handling, feature scaling, and data type conversions. Created validation rules for data quality. | High missing data rates (15%) in implied volatility field. Deciding between imputation strategies and their business impact. | Tested multiple imputation strategies. Found 19.3% performance improvement by dropping missing values vs imputation. Documented trade-offs. | Investigate missing data mechanisms. Develop more sophisticated imputation methods. Add automated data quality alerts. |
| **7. Outlier Analysis** | Used statistical methods to identify extreme values in options data. Analyzed impact of outliers on model performance. | Difficulty distinguishing between data errors and legitimate extreme market events. Some outliers may represent valid market stress conditions. | Applied domain knowledge to validate outliers. Kept legitimate extreme values while removing clear data errors. Documented outlier treatment decisions. | Develop more sophisticated outlier detection using market context. Add real-time outlier monitoring. Create business rules for outlier handling. |
| **8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Created visualizations of price distributions, volatility patterns, and feature correlations. Analyzed relationships between variables. | Complex relationships between options variables not immediately obvious. Some patterns unclear due to market complexity. | Used multiple visualization techniques. Focused on business-relevant patterns. Created summary statistics for different market segments. | Add more sophisticated statistical analysis. Include time-series decomposition. Create interactive visualizations for stakeholders. |
| **9. Feature Engineering** | Created moneyness (S/K ratio) and volatility-time interaction features. Applied domain knowledge to construct meaningful variables. | Limited domain expertise in options pricing theory. Difficult to validate feature usefulness without extensive testing. | Researched options pricing fundamentals. Created simple, interpretable features. Validated feature importance through model performance. | Add more sophisticated options Greeks. Include volatility surface features. Implement automated feature selection methods. |
| **10. Modeling (Regression / Time Series / Classification)** | Implemented linear regression models with cross-validation. Compared different imputation strategies and model specifications. | Low model performance (R² = 15.6%) indicating weak linear relationships. Stochastic training results making comparison difficult. | Focused on model interpretability over complexity. Used bootstrap validation for confidence intervals. Documented model limitations clearly. | Try non-linear models (random forest, neural networks). Add more features from options theory. Implement ensemble methods. |
| **11. Evaluation & Risk Communication** | Conducted bootstrap analysis with 600 iterations. Performed sensitivity analysis across scenarios. Analyzed performance by strike price segments. | Wide confidence intervals indicating high uncertainty. Significant performance differences across market segments. Low overall explanatory power. | Communicated uncertainty explicitly through confidence intervals. Identified high-risk scenarios. Recommended manual oversight for model deployment. | Develop more robust evaluation metrics. Add stress testing scenarios. Implement automated model monitoring. |
| **12. Results Reporting, Delivery Design & Stakeholder Communication** | Created markdown reports with executive summary, risk assessment, and technical details. Focused on business implications rather than technical details. | Translating technical findings into business language. Communicating model limitations without undermining confidence. | Used clear visualizations and plain language. Structured reports for different stakeholder types. Provided specific recommendations with risk context. | Create interactive dashboards. Develop automated reporting pipelines. Add more business context to technical findings. |
| **13. Productization** | Built Flask API and Streamlit dashboard for model deployment. Created utility functions and error handling. Packaged model with metadata for production use. | Managing dependencies across deployment environments. Handling model version compatibility. Creating user-friendly interfaces for non-technical users. | Created dedicated environment with pinned dependencies. Implemented comprehensive error handling and input validation. Built automated testing for API endpoints. | Add authentication and logging. Implement A/B testing framework. Create monitoring dashboards for production use. |
| **14. Deployment & Monitoring** | Designed monitoring strategy across data, model, system, and business layers. Created alerting thresholds and escalation procedures. | Defining appropriate monitoring thresholds without historical data. Balancing alert sensitivity with noise. Planning ownership and response procedures. | Set conservative thresholds based on validation results. Created clear escalation paths. Planned manual fallback procedures for critical failures. | Implement real-time monitoring dashboard. Add automated rollback capabilities. Develop comprehensive runbooks for incident response. |
| **15. Orchestration & System Design** | Designed 7-task pipeline from data fetch to report generation. Created DAG structure with proper dependencies. Planned automation strategy based on risk assessment. | Managing complex dependencies between pipeline tasks. Deciding what to automate given model limitations. Handling failure recovery and retries. | Created clear task boundaries with defined inputs/outputs. Prioritized automation for low-risk data tasks. Kept model tasks manual due to performance concerns. | Implement actual orchestration platform. Add comprehensive retry logic. Develop automated testing for pipeline components. |
| **16. Lifecycle Review & Reflection** | Completed comprehensive review of all lifecycle stages. Documented challenges, solutions, and improvement opportunities across the full project. | Connecting decisions across stages and understanding cumulative impact. Identifying most critical improvement areas. | Created structured framework mapping each stage. Prioritized improvements based on business impact and technical feasibility. | Apply lessons learned to next project. Focus on upfront planning and domain expertise. Invest in better tooling and automation infrastructure. |

## Reflection Summary

**Most Difficult Stage**: Model evaluation and risk communication, due to the challenge of honestly communicating severe model limitations (R² = 15.6%) while still providing value to stakeholders.

**Most Rewarding Stage**: Productization, where technical work was transformed into usable applications that stakeholders could interact with directly.

**Key Connections**: Early scoping decisions (simple linear model) constrained later modeling options but enabled faster iteration and clearer communication. Data quality issues in preprocessing directly impacted model performance and deployment confidence.

**Future Project Changes**: Invest more time in domain research and feature engineering upfront. Plan for model limitations from the beginning rather than discovering them late in the process.

**Skills to Strengthen**: Options pricing theory, advanced feature engineering techniques, production monitoring and alerting systems, stakeholder communication for technical uncertainty.
