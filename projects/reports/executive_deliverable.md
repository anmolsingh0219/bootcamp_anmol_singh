# ML-Enhanced Options Pricing Model
## Executive Deliverable & Business Case

---

**Project**: Black-Scholes Error Prediction Model    

---

## Executive Summary

### The Business Problem
Traditional Black-Scholes option pricing contains systematic errors that cost trading firms money through mispriced options. Our analysis shows these errors average $4.60 per option contract, leading to significant trading losses and reduced competitiveness.

### Our Solution
We developed a machine learning model that predicts and corrects Black-Scholes pricing errors, achieving **78% improvement** in pricing accuracy with average errors reduced to **$1.03 per contract**.

### Key Results
- **Best Model**: Random Forest Regressor
- **Pricing Accuracy**: $1.03 average error (vs $4.60 baseline)
- **Prediction Confidence**: R² = 0.692 (69% of variance explained)
- **Business Impact**: 78% reduction in pricing errors
- **Implementation**: Production-ready with real-time capabilities
